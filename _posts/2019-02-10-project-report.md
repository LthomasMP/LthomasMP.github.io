## Description

I share the report of my MSc graduation project of Télécom SudParis. This project was done with my teammate [Nicolas Bonnet](https://github.com/bonnetn), and in collaboration with the company [Advens](https://www.advens.fr/).

## About the report

This report is divided in 3 parts.
The first part is a state of the art about phishing.
The second part is a  description of the Office macros ofuscator that we developed. You can find the project on Github [here](https://github.com/bonnetn/vba-obfuscator/).
The final part is about PDF malwares.

The whole report is in French. For people that don't understand this lovely language, I am sorry. Don't hesitate to contact me or my teammate if you have questions about the project, we will answer you with pleasure.

You can download the report [here](/files/2019-02-10/Report.pdf), and don't forget to visit the project's Github repo. Enjoy!
