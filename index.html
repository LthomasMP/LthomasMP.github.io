	<h1>About this site</h1>
	<p>This is the beginning of my blog. Nothing special on it for the moment, but some content will pop when the site will be perfectly set up.</p>
	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a student in network and system security MSc at Telecom SudParis (France). I enjoy system security and binary exploitation. I believe that writing about things that 
	I love is the best way to learn and to improve.</p>
	<p>You can contact me by <a href=mailto:{{site.email}}>mail</a> or find me on <a href={{site.linkedin}}>LinkedIn.</a></p>
