	<h1>About this site</h1>
	<p>This is the beginning of my blog. Posts will be better with time (I hope). You can find some CTF corrections, and soon some deeper content.</p>

	<p>I am junior software security engineer at Thales in France.</p>
	<p>I love looking deep in binaries and in OS, understanding vulnerabilities and their exploits. I also enjoy reverse engineering binaries, and software engineering in Go.</p>
	<p>You can contact me by <a href=mailto:{{site.email}}>mail</a> or find me on <a href={{site.linkedin}}>LinkedIn.</a></p>
